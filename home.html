                Press the above 'game' tab on the navigation bar to start! You will go through three stages.
                The first stage: Identify the answer to your given problem and type (using the keyboard) your answer.
                Click on the next button (using a mouse or equivalent) to submit your answer.
                The second stage: The catching stage! Click on the ball in the specified location to catch it and move on.
                Be careful! Missing the ball will result in resetting the game!
                The final stage: The throwing stage! Select your power level using the cursor and dragging the arrow on the power bar.
                This is calculated using the pythagorean theorem. Use the distance and height from the hoop as your 'a' and 'b' values.
                Your 'c' value will be equivalent to the power level needed to shoot the ball into the net.
                This game will keep looping untill you run out of time. How high can you score?!
