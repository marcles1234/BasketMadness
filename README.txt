Welcome to Basket Madness!

This folder contains all files needed to run the game. The assets folder is required but not used directly from the page. The assets files exist here to be uploaded to the GitHub repo and images are ripped from there.

My webpage uses Bootstrap and Phaser3 to operate so running the website from a local server environment (I used WAMP.net). Running the files from here will make everything work as expected.

***IMPORTANT: OPEN FILE TITLED 'BasketGame.html' TO START THE WEBSITE***

The website itself gives a description on how to operate but here is an overview:

Home:
Just contains instructions and a navigation bar. Click 'Basketball' for game and 'Questions' for questions

Basketball:
Starts on question stage. Default questions are used if no custom questions are selected. Type your answer anywhere and hit 'Submit' to continue.
Next is catching the ball. Click anywhere within the designated catch area when the ball is within the limits to catch.
Final stage is the power. Calculate the power by using Pythagorean's theorem (Sqrt(height^2 + distance^2)). Drag the arrow to the answer required (round answer up or down as required). 

Question:
Input your custom ten question and answers in the provided boxes. Press save button to start the file download. The file is, by default, downloaded to your computers download folder. Re-name the file as appropriate.
To use these created questions or upload this created file in the future, simply select the upload file button and select the chosen file. This adds it to the games question bank.
If you have already visited the game page prior to creating/uploading your own questions you will need to restart the website and upload the file before visiting the game.
